Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating application deployment, scaling, and management. It was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

Each node runs workloads scheduled by Kubernetes. These could be Linux, Windows, ARM or Virtual depending on your configuration.
