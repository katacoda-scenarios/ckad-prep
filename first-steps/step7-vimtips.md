Vim has multiple modes that changes how it responds to keyboard input. The current mode is defined at the bottom of the terminal in the status bar.

Pressing <kbd>i</kbd> will turn Vim into _--INSERT--_ mode, allowing you to make changes. 

Pressing <kbd>ESC</kbd> will return Vim to normal mode. To save an exit a file, in normal mode, type <kbd>:wq</kbd>.
