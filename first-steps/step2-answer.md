The Kubernetes API defines different objects to solve day-to-day problems which can be extended using Custom Resource Definitions.

For example, Crontab will launch a Pod at particular times. A DaemonSet will ensure that a deployment is running on every node in the cluster, great for collecting and aggregating metrics.
